# Wallpaper Engine for KDE

Live wallpapers from [Wallpaper Engine](https://store.steampowered.com/app/431960/Wallpaper_Engine), running natively in KDE Plasma 6. Scene, Web, and Video wallpapers all work, drawn by a custom Vulkan renderer — no emulation, no Windows code involved.

This is the actively maintained continuation of the original [catsout](https://github.com/catsout/wallpaper-engine-kde-plugin) plugin, rebuilt for Plasma 6 and Qt 6 with the old Python dependency gone for good.

📖 **Full documentation lives in the [Wiki](https://github.com/CaptSilver/wallpaper-engine-kde-plugin/wiki).** This README is just enough to get you running.

## Install

**Arch (AUR)** — the easy path:

```sh
yay -S wallpaper-engine-kde-plugin-new-fork
```

**Fedora / Bazzite / rpm-ostree** — grab the RPM from [Releases](https://github.com/CaptSilver/wallpaper-engine-kde-plugin/releases):

```sh
sudo dnf install ./wallpaper-engine-kde-plugin-qt6-*.rpm    # Fedora
rpm-ostree install ./wallpaper-engine-kde-plugin-qt6-*.rpm  # Bazzite / Silverblue
```

**Ubuntu / Debian** — grab the `.deb` from [Releases](https://github.com/CaptSilver/wallpaper-engine-kde-plugin/releases). You'll need Ubuntu 25.04+ or Debian Trixie+ (anything older ships a Qt that's too old):

```sh
sudo apt install ./wallpaper-engine-kde-plugin_*.deb
```

**Building from source?** That's all in the wiki: [Installation](https://github.com/CaptSilver/wallpaper-engine-kde-plugin/wiki/Installation).

## Set it up

1. Install [Wallpaper Engine](https://store.steampowered.com/app/431960/Wallpaper_Engine) on Steam and subscribe to a few wallpapers from the Workshop.
2. Right-click the desktop → **Configure Desktop and Wallpaper**.
3. Set **Wallpaper Type** to **Wallpaper Engine for KDE**.
4. Point **Steam Library** at the folder that holds your `steamapps` directory. Usually that's `~/.local/share/Steam`, including on Bazzite, which ships Steam natively rather than as a Flatpak. If you did install Steam as a Flatpak, point at `~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/.local/share/Steam` instead.
5. Pick a wallpaper and hit **Apply**.

Not sure which folder to point at? This lists every Steam library on disk:

```sh
find $HOME /run/media -maxdepth 6 -name steamapps -type d 2>/dev/null
```

Multi-monitor, per-screen settings, and playlists are covered in [Usage](https://github.com/CaptSilver/wallpaper-engine-kde-plugin/wiki/Usage).

## What works

| Type | Rendered by | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| **Scene** (2D/3D) | custom Vulkan renderer | Wallpaper Engine assets |
| **Web** (HTML/JS) | QtWebEngine | Wallpaper Engine assets |
| **Video** | MPV, or GStreamer as fallback | a video file |

The Scene renderer handles most of what Wallpaper Engine throws at it: particles, post-processing, SceneScript, audio reactivity, and text layers. The full feature breakdown is in [Scene Renderer](https://github.com/CaptSilver/wallpaper-engine-kde-plugin/wiki/Scene-Renderer).

## Requirements

To run it: KDE Plasma 6, Qt 6, and a working Vulkan 1.1+ driver (AMD users want RADV). Building from source also needs a C++20 compiler — Clang is what we build with.

## Something not working?

[Troubleshooting](https://github.com/CaptSilver/wallpaper-engine-kde-plugin/wiki/Troubleshooting) and [Known Issues](https://github.com/CaptSilver/wallpaper-engine-kde-plugin/wiki/Known-Issues) cover the common ones — empty wallpaper lists, black desktops, missing audio.

### Known fixes in this branch

- **Web wallpapers showing white/black** (init handshake + properties): `setLoaded`, `pushGeneralProperties` and `pushUserProperties` are exposed to QML as writable `Q_PROPERTY`s (`webobj.loaded`, `webobj.generalProperties`, `webobj.userProperties`) instead of calling non-`Q_INVOKABLE` C++ methods, which failed with `TypeError: ... is not a function` and left web wallpapers blank. Also `settings.localContentCanAccessFileUrls = true` so injected `file://` sub-resources load.
- **Full Steam library path** preserved (`Common.urlNative(cfg_SteamLibraryPath)` in `getProjectDirs`) — previously root-anchored `/steamapps/...` paths broke relative asset resolution and wallpaper watching.
- **Huge Scene sprites rendered blank** (e.g. Hackercore `7680x8000`): the cumulative texture budget `kMaxTotalBytes` is now overridable at build time via `-DWEK_MAX_TEX_BYTES=...` (default 2 GiB, `#ifndef` in `WPTexImageParser.cpp`, wired through submodule CMake). Low-VRAM machines can lower it; high-VRAM cards can raise it. See [backend_scene](src/backend_scene) for details.
